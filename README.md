PkmnPLSolver
============

Uses a DFS to brute-force puzzles from Pokemon Puzzle League because seriously it's been 15 years and I've spent several hours on these last two puzzles already

It gives the solution step by step so you can only spoil the first step for you if you want

EDIT: oh god it unlocked 130 more puzzles
